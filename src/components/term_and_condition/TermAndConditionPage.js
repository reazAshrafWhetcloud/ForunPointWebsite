          If your card is declined, you will receive an error message. No
          payment will be charged to your card and no order will be processed.
          There may be a pending transaction on your account until your card
          issuing bank withdraws the authorization. This usually takes 2 to 5
          business days. Your card may be declined for various reasons such as
          insufficient funds, AVS (Address Verification System) mismatch or you
          have entered an incorrect security code.
